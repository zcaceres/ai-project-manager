 Write a Project plan for a new initiative that we have to migrate our infrastructure from a Platform as a Service to AWS. Your plan should include a new project, tickets, and a detailed PRD. We have multiple worker instances running NodeJS that handle cron jobs and other such tasks. We have two server instances both host our express servers. We'll use AWS hosted services like EC2s for our infrastructure. We use a Postgres database. Your spec should include tickets for stakeholder coordination, QA, launch planning, a responsible approach to rolling our this change which would include slowly introducing traffic/load onto the system until we throttle all traffic to 100% on our new AWS infrastructure. Include estimations and priorities in the tickets as well.
